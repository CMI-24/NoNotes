- [ ] Fixed point theorem
      $M$ is a complete metric space.
      $T:M\to M$ is continuous.
      $d(T(p), T(q))<k(d(p,q))$, where $k$ is a constant less than 1.
      Then, $T$ has a unique fixed point (If $T(x_{0}) = x_{0}$, then, $x_{0}$ is called a fixed point).
      It is easy to see that at most one fixed point can exist for $T$ given the distance inequality.

# HW 3

~~HW 1 material (not for the quiz).~~

~~Chapter 1: everything except the appendix. Proofs of 1.21 (construction of n-th roots) and 1.35 (Cauchy-Schwarz for complex numbers) are left to you.~~

Chapter 2: ~~2.1 to 2.3~~, ~~2.7, 2.9 to 2.11~~, ~~On metric spaces: 2.15, 2.16, 2.18 (a) -- we called this an open ball -- and (i). From this chapter only the metric space material will be tested in the quiz.~~

Chapter 3: 3.1 to 3.16 with the differences listed below. We will discuss limsup/liminf further in class but 3.18 and 3.19 are left for you. The special limits in 3.20 are also left for you to read.

We did not deal with the terms "limit point, closed, compact". So we did not do 3.2d, 3.6a, 3.7, 3.10, 3.11b (we will do all of these later) and we gave different arguments for 3.6b and 3.11c using monotone convergence theorem and the notion of peaks of a sequence. However we did define a version of compactness ("sequential compactness" = the property stated in the conclusion of 3.6a) and we proved the analogue of 3.11b for sequentially compact metric spaces. We gave a different definition for limsup/liminf compared to 3.16.

Hi all, we have just started seeing the main action in this course. **Do NOT miss classes.** If you are struggling, talk to me asap. You can email me to set up a meeting. 

1) Plan for tomorrow’s classes:

- 4.8 continuity in terms of open sets.
- Topology material in 2.18-2.30

I suggest you do the following work beforehand.

- Carefully prove in detail the results in 4.4, 4.9-4.11 on your own.
- Show that any ball B in a metric space is a neighborhood of each point in B. Deduce that a function between metric spaces is continuous if and only f inverse (any ball) = union of balls.

Depending on time we will start studying the enormously important notion of compactness (2.31-2.41), which we have already encountered in its sequential manifestation. How compactness interacts with continuity (4.13-4.21) is part of the core foundational material in topology and analysis. We will attempt to complete discussion of this material next week.

2) In yesterday’s evening sessions we did the following

- 1.21 existence of n-th roots in Theorem 1.21
- 3.20 standard limits (of sequences)
- Geometric proof of Cauchy-Schwarz using (i) Pythagorean theorem (ii) orthogonal projection of one vector on another
- Finite, infinite, countably infinite and uncountable sets.

3) Regarding (un)countability, for this course you do need to understand basic definitions, examples and results. This material will be needed for some useful results _in analysis,_ e.g. see 4.30. Here is a summary of basic knowledge you should have beyond definitions.

- Following are countable: Q, union of countable sets over finite or even countable indexing set, _finite product_ of countable sets, infinite subset or infinite image of a countable set
- Following are uncountable: power set of N (so _countable product_ of even a finite set is not countable), real numbers

Suggested exercises

- No set S can be in bijection with its power set (classic Cantor diagonalization argument)
- Try to prove the Schroder-Bernstein theorem: if there is an injection from S to T and an injection from T to S, then there is a bijection between S and T. Then locate a proof and see if you can read a little and complete the rest.

# HW 4

**Do for yourself but do not submit.**

1. Read the following material and prove all statements carefully on your own. 

- 4.4, 4.9 and 4.10 using sequences, 4.11 (mostly sketched in class)
- Corollary in 4.8: f is continuous iff inverse image of any _closed_ set is _closed_ (follows directly from what we proved but I forgot to mention in class)
- 2.27 (a+c was our definition of closure), equivalence with 2.26 (was stated in class, you should supply the easy proof), 2.28 (easy), 2.30 (assigned in class)

2. Problems from Rudin

- Chapter 2: 2 to 5, 7 to 11 (most can be done orally)
- Chapter 4: 1, 3, 5 (only the last requires work)
- Chapter 2: 22 to 24 are not required but are recommended

**Submit the following five problems.**

2.6, 2.29, 4.2, 4.4, 4.7  (For unboundedness of f restrict f to a suitable curve. Ditto for discontinuity of g.)

Hint for 2.29: Let the given open set be U. The desired open intervals in U should be “maximal” and partition U. For points x, y in U, declare x ~ y if [x,y] is a subset of U. For countability, use rational numbers. (Just for thought: can we say something similar about _closed_ subsets of the real line in terms of closed intervals, possibly singletons?)


# Thu sep 19 sit rep

Hi all,

1. As announced in class yesterday, I’m seriously considering **holding the midterm on Monday Oct 7**, the day immediately after the midterm week. Note that this is a regular working day, so there is no excuse to be absent.

2. I have **extended the deadline for HW 4 by 24 hours**, i.e., till the end of tomorrow Fri Sep 20.

3. Tomorrow’s classes are crucial. We will discuss compactness. **Before class you should do the following three tasks**. All are easy. The third one may require careful wording.

(i) Prove that a metric space X is limit point compact if and only if X is sequentially compact. 

(ii) Read the definitions 2.31 and 2.32 explaining the notion compactness via open covers. This is a bit more involved that the other two versions used in task (i). You will likely need some time to learn how to use open cover compactness and gain some appreciation for it. It will help to familiarize yourself with the definition before class.

(iii) Recall what it means to say that sequential and limit point compactness are _intrinsic_ notions. Similarly, open cover compactness too can be defined in two ways: for a metric space X or, as the book does, for a subset E of a metric space X. The second way seems more general, but once again see that there is no essential difference between the two, i.e., prove that E is compact as a subset of X according to the second definition if and only if E is compact according to the first definition as a metric space on its own right. Then show that open cover compactness is also intrinsic. See Rudin’s formulation of this in 2.33.

Main topics I’d like to cover tomorrow.

(a) open cover compactness, examples and non-examples of compact sets, analogue of nested interval theorem  
(b) topology of compact sets: closed subset of a compact set is compact, compact subset in any metric space X is closed in X and bounded in X, converse true in R^n (Heine-Borel)  
(c) continuity and compactness: continuous image of a compact set is compact, extreme value theorem, uniform continuity: definition and equivalence with continuity when domain is compact 
(d) Equivalence of three notions of compactness for metric spaces
