Ranges are a way of making lists that are arithmetic sequences of elements that can be enumerated. `[1..20]` is the equivalent of writing `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]`.
Letters can be enumerated too.
A step can be specified by adding an element after the first element.
To make a list with all the numbers from 20 to 1, you can't just do `[20..1]`, you have to do `[20,19..1]`.
Be wary of floating point imprecision.
