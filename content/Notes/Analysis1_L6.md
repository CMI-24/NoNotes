$\{ P_{n} \}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ ($f: \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \to  \mathbb{R}$)

"$\lim_{ n \to \infty } P_{n} = p$" means
	$\forall \epsilon >0$ there exists a positive integer $n$ such that for all $n>N$, $|P_{n}-p|<\epsilon$  
Can be easily generalized to a metric space $(X, d)$, where $X$ is a set(?) and $d$ is the distance function.
