## Boundedness

>[!Definition]
>Suppose $S$ is an [[Ordered sets|ordered set]], $E\subset S$. If there exists a $\beta\in S$ such that $x\leq\beta$ for every $x\in E$, we say that $E$ is *bounded above*, and call $\beta$ an *upper bound* of $E$. 

## Supremum and infimum

>[!Definition]
>Suppose $S$ is an ordered set, $E\subset S$, and $E$ is bounded above. Suppose there exists an $\alpha\in S$ with the following properties:
>- $\alpha$ is an upper bound of $E$.
>- If $\gamma<\alpha$, then $\gamma$ is not an upper bound of $E$.
>
>Then $\alpha$ is called the *least upper bound* or *supremum* of $E$. 

Analogous definitions exist for *bounded below* and *infimum*.
Note that $\sup A$ and $\inf A$ may or may not be in $A$.
