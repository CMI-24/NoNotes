Consists of [[The real field]] and two symbols, $+\infty$ and $-\infty$. We preserve the original order in $\mathbb{R}$ and define
$$
-\infty<x<+\infty
$$
for every $x\in \mathbb{R}$.

$+\infty$ is an upper bound for every subset of the extended real number system, and every non empty subset has an upper bound. Ditto for $-\infty$.

The extended real number system does not form a field.
