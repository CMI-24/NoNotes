>[!Definition]
>An ordered set $S$ is said to have the *least upper bound property* if for every subset $E$ of $S$, where $E$ is non empty and [[Bounds|bounded]] above, $\sup E$ exists in $S$. 

An analogous definition exists for the GLB property. Having the LUB property is the same thing as having the GLB property.
