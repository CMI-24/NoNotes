Proof of why no set other than $\mathbb{R}$ and $\phi$ can be both open and closed in $\mathbb{R}$.

Discussed the cantor set, and how to prove that it has uncountably many elements by building a bijection between the cantor set and the interval $[0, 1]$.

Showed every point in the cantor set is a cluster point of the cantor set.
											of the complement of the cantor set.

If $X$ and $Y$ are compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, show that $X\times Y$ is compact.
