## Subspace

>[!Definition]
>A *subspace* of a [[Vector spaces#Axioms|vector space]] $V$ is a non-empty subset $V_{0}\subset V$ which is closed under the operations (addition, scaling) inherited from $V$.

The subspaces $V$ and $\{ \mathbf{0} \}$ are called *trivial subspaces* of $V$. 

With Each [[Linear Transformations#Linear transformations|linear transformation]] $A:V\to W$ we can associate the following two subspaces:
1. The *null space*, or *kernel* of $A$, which is denoted as $\text{Null }A$ or $\text{Ker }A$ and consists of all vectors $\mathbf{v}\in V$ such that $A\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{0}$.
2. The *range* $\text{Ran }A$, the set of all vectors $\mathbf{w}\in W$ which can be represented as $\mathbf{w}=A\mathbf{v}$ for some $\mathbf{v}\in V$.
