## Problems
- find the number of elements in $GL_{2}(\mathbb{F}_{p})$. << this is the set of all nxxn matrices.
- Show that $AB-BA=I$,  $A, B, I\in M_{n}(\mathbb{R})$ has no solution.
- Prove that $\{ a+bi\ |\ a,b\in \mathbb{F}_{3} \}$ has nine elements and is a field.

- $A,B$ are $n\times n$ matrices and $A+B=AB$. then show that $AB=BA$.
- In a town with $n$ people, $m$ clubs have been formed. Every club has odd number of members, and every two clubs have even number of members in common. PT $m\le n$.
